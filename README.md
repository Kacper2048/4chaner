# 4chaner
This super software is used to download photos from 4chan (all pictures from specified section / thread)

I used it to downloads a lot of memes soo If you dont want to waste a time for downloads them It will be helpfull program :D

It works on UNIX systems. It have problem with specific links so files from that server ( i.4cdn.org) can't be downloaded :/
At this moment, polish version is only avaiable

It require curl library to work
You can download it form https://curl.se/
To comile that sotfware you have to use makefiles, then you have to run it and during the work, programs will ask you about link to specyfied thread it will download from.
